# Semantic Versioning

`major.minor.patch`

* `major`: Update makes a breaking change to the API
* `minor`: Update adds feature(s) in a backwards-compatible manner
* `patch`: Update makes backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Why Use It?

Semantic versioning helps developers clearly communicate to their users about new package versions and their expected compatibility. This is particularly helpful when you are building a package that other developers will depend on for their own projects.
