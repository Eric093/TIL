# Sketching and Logo Creation

These notes were created as I watched [Sketching and Logo Creation (with Maggie Appleton) - Learn With Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mrrNAjiTvk)

Process for coming up with illustrations:

1. Start with the project/company name.
1. What are 3-5 big ideas that you want to convey through your logo?
1. For each of those words, do some word association. Come up with a long list of words that are related to the big idea word.
    1. [OneLook](https://onelook.com/thesaurus)
1. Find a wide variety of photo references. Different angles. Build a board of all those reference photos.
1. Find connections or ways to combine words from your long word association lists. Draw a bunch of idea sketches. Don't critique yet, quantity over quality!
    1. [SCAMPER](https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-problem-solving-using-scamper-technique/): idea generation technique
1. Pick the best ideas and flesh them out more. Do a few more iterations of each.
    1. Play with shape, lighting.
1. Do final vector work in Illustrator.
