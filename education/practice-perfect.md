# Practice Perfect

Notes from reading [Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better](https://teachlikeachampion.com/books/practice-perfect/) by Doug Lemov, Erica Woolway, and Katie Yezzi.

## Why Practice?

Here's what the process for learning looks like:

* When you first start learning a new subject, there's a lot to learn. It requires lots of mental energy just to keep the basics straight.
* As you practice repeatedly using that new skill, you start to develop proficiency. You understand the fundamentals, and you can apply them in certain recognizable scenarios. Most people stop here, because they feel like they "get it." But they should keep going.
* If you continue to practice even more, your proficiency turns into mastery. You have unconscious, automated responses that let you use your new skill in a variety of different scenarios. Because you don't have to consciously think about the basics anymore, your brain is free to do more creative problem solving and focus on higher-order thinking (making connections, having insights).

It's like learning how to drive. At first, there are lots of things to think about, and managing the vehicle takes your complete focus. But as you build mastery, your muscle memory takes care of the driving, and your mind is free to wander.

## How to Practice

1) Figure out what to practice. Analyze successful "players" to see what traits they have in common. What makes them great?
1) Once you've identified the skills needed for success, create a drill that lets you practice that skill in isolation.
    * Give your drill a name to make it easy to reference.
    * Have an objective for your drill. A goal to know when you've done enough practice. (e.g., "Play scales three times in a row without making any mistakes.")
1) Practice! If possible, practice in an environment similar to the real-world scenario, so that recall is easier in the actual "game."
    * Start simple, with one scripted scenario.
    * Then, add in variations that target the same skill but in slightly different scenarios.
    * Then try mixing up drills for a few different skills at once, to practice matching the right skill to a given scenario.
1) Use "scrimmages" or larger simulations to assess mastery and readiness for the real thing.

### Tips for Facilitating Practice

* Watch and give feedback to participants as soon as possible.
    * Praise what they do well (bright spots) so that they can keep working on what they already excel at.
    * Make corrections specific and have them try again with the feedback incorporated as soon as possible (immediately is best).

## Feedback

> "...If you really care about somebody, you give them constructive feedback. And if you don't care about somebody you only say positive things."
> - Maigread Eichten, in a NY Times interview

Need help figuring out how to word your feedback? Here are some sentence starters to try out:

* For positive feedback: "One thing I thought was really effective was..."
* For constructive feedback: "What if you tried..."

Give feedback frequently - both good and bad. Feedback should be:

* Timely. Deliver feedback ASAP. As close to the moment as possible.
* Specific. Identify the action they should replicate (for praise) or correct (for critique).
* Focused. Prioritize the 1-2 most important pieces. Don't just dump every thought on them.
* Solution-oriented. Tell them what to do (vs. just describing the problem).

There are some variables that play into the way feedback should be given:

* Time. Is this something that can be addressed in the moment, or does it warrant a longer conversation later on (once the practice session is over)?
* Power dynamic. Is this feedback being given from a manager to an employee? From an employee to a manager? From one peer to another?

After giving someone feedback:

* Check for understanding. Ask them to repeat back what you said, to make sure you're on the same page. "Should we both check our understanding here?"
* Identify the next action they'll take to implement the feedback.
