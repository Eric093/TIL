# Practice Perfect

Notes from reading [Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better](https://teachlikeachampion.com/books/practice-perfect/) by Doug Lemov, Erica Woolway, and Katie Yezzi.

## Why Practice?

Here's what the process for learning looks like:

* When you first start learning a new subject, there's a lot to learn. It requires lots of mental energy just to keep the basics straight.
* As you practice repeatedly using that new skill, you start to develop proficiency. You understand the fundamentals, and you can apply them in certain recognizable scenarios.
* If you continue to practice even more, your proficiency turns into mastery. You have unconscious, automated responses that let you use your new skill in a variety of different scenarios. Because you don't have to consciously think about the basics anymore, your brain is free to do more creative problem solving and focus on higher-order thinking (making connections, having insights).

It's like learning how to drive. At first, there are lots of things to think about, and managing the vehicle takes your complete focus. But as you build mastery, your muscle memory takes care of the driving, and your mind is free to wander.

## How to Practice

1) Analyze successful "players" to see what traits they have in common. What makes them great?
1) Once you've identified the skills needed for success, create a drill that lets you practice that skill in isolation.
    * Give your drill a name to make it easy to reference.
1) Practice! If possible, practice in an environment similar to the
    * Start simple, with one scripted scenario.
    * Then, add in variations that target the same skill but in slightly different scenarios.
    * Then try mixing up drills for a few different skills at once, to practice matching the right skill to a given scenario.
