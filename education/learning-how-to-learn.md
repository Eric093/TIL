# Learning How To Learn

[A Coursera Course by Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

## Focused and Diffuse Thinking

There are two kinds of thinking that your brain is capable of:

* **Focused** thinking
    * Used when trying to do familiar tasks, with already established neural pathways.
    * It's like going on a drive when you're running errands. It's a thing you've done before, it's a path you know well, and you're trying to get there quickly and get something done.
    * This happens mainly in your brain's prefrontal cortex.
* **Diffuse** thinking: more relaxed
    * Used when forming new ideas for the first time.
    * It's like going out for a drive with no real destination. The roads all exist already (like the neurons and synapses in your brain), but you're going to take an ambling kind of approach and just see where you end up. And sometimes you'll end up somewhere interesting (at a new thought or idea).
    * This mode is what your brain uses in it's neural resting states.
    
Imagine a pinball machine in your brain. When you have a thought, it's like firing the pinball. The pinball bounces around in your brain, and its path changes directions when it hits different rubber bumpers. When your brain is in focus mode, it's like those bumpers are really close together. When your brain is in diffuse mode, it's like the bumpers are farther apart.

> Metaphors and analogies are helpful for learning new things.

Your brain can only be in one mode at a time. It's like a coin - you can't see both sides of the coin at once. When you're learning something new, you need to be able to bounce back and forth between the two modes. You also need to spend adequate time learning the new material. It's like getting better at lifting weights: you don't just jump in all at once and start with the heaviest weight; you start small and gradually work your way up by doing a little bit every day.

## What is Learning?

A quick download from Dominic: Your brain is made up of neurons. Each neuron can have multiple dendrites, which are like little branches that reach out from the neuron to other neurons. The places where a dendrite connects to another neuron (at the axon) are called synapses. A single dendrite can have multiple synapses.

Contrary to popular belief, your brain is creating new neurons all the time, even after your brain has matured. New neurons are created in your hippocampus - the part of your brain responsible for learning and memory.

Your brain creates and removes connections between neurons every day - that's how you learn new things. When you learn something new and the pinball starts bouncing around, your brain reinforces the synapses on the path that the pinball bounced. As you keep using a concept over time, those synapses get stronger and stronger and the paths between neurons get more established. That makes it easier for you to recall information more quickly.

Connections are stronger when you're in an enriched environment (with stimulation and other people). In the absence of an enriched environment, exercise will also increase the number of new neurons created.

## Procrastination

When you don't want to do something, the pain part of your brain is active. Your brain wants to stop that by switching your attention to something else. But it turns out that you also stop that neural discomfort by just doing the thing you don't want to do.

> üçÖ **The Pomodoro Technique:** Remove yourself from any distractions. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Do the thing you don't want to do. When the timer goes off, reward yourself by doing something else. It's like a mental workout.

## Practice Makes Permanent

The more abstract an idea, the more practice you need to strengthen those neural connections. As you practice, you're strengthening the connections between neurons, and making that pathway more established in your brain. Practice is how you make those neural pathways permanent.

When you're learning something new, spend some time focusing on it, then take a break to let your brain's diffuse mode keep working on it in the background. It's important to take breaks, because that's what's cementing your mental foundation. If you cram, it's like building a wall without giving the cement proper time to dry - it's going to end up looking like a mess.

## Memory

* Long-term memory is where you store information (like a hard drive).
    * Like a storage warehouse. It's big, and there are lots of places to put things.
    * Different kinds of memories are in different parts of your brain.
* Working memory is what you're currently thinking about (like RAM).
    * Based in your prefrontal cortex.
    * Like a bad blackboard. It has limited space, and stuff gets erased quickly.

Your working memory can only hold about four chunks of information at a time. Sometimes you'll have to use repetition to keep reminding yourself of the information so it doesn't get automatically erased by your brain's clean-up processes.

When you first try to put something in long-term memory, you'll have to practice recalling it so that your brain can remember where it put that memory (like trying to find something packed away in your storage unit). This should be done gradually, over the course of many days. This is called **spaced repetition**. Spaced repetition is more effective than cramming the same amount of practice into one day.

## The Importance of Sleep

Being awake creates toxins in your brain. When you sleep, your brain cells shrink, which makes space to let your brain clean out the toxins.

When you sleep, your brain also cleans up and strengthens neural connections. It cleans up less important connections and strengthens the ones for important memories that you want to remember. Your brain also keeps rehearsing the hard things you were working on in focus mode before going to sleep.

For greatest success, work on the thing you're trying to learn right before taking a nap or going to bed. This increases the likelihood that you'll dream about it, which helps your brain organize that information into chunks, which helps you learn it better.
