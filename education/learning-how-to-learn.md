# Learning How To Learn

[A Coursera Course by Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

## Focused and Diffuse Thinking

There are two kinds of thinking that your brain is capable of:

* **Focused** thinking
    * Used when trying to do familiar tasks, with already established neural pathways.
    * It's like going on a drive when you're running errands. It's a thing you've done before, it's a path you know well, and you're trying to get there quickly and get something done.
    * This happens mainly in your brain's prefrontal cortex.
* **Diffuse** thinking: more relaxed
    * Used when forming new ideas for the first time.
    * It's like going out for a drive with no real destination. The roads all exist already (like the neurons and synapses in your brain), but you're going to take an ambling kind of approach and just see where you end up. And sometimes you'll end up somewhere interesting (at a new thought or idea).
    * This mode is what your brain uses in it's neural resting states.
    
Imagine a pinball machine in your brain. When you have a thought, it's like firing the pinball. The pinball bounces around in your brain, and its path changes directions when it hits different rubber bumpers. When your brain is in focus mode, it's like those bumpers are really close together. When your brain is in diffuse mode, it's like the bumpers are farther apart.

> Metaphors and analogies are helpful for learning new things.

Your brain can only be in one mode at a time. It's like a coin - you can't see both sides of the coin at once. When you're learning something new, you need to be able to bounce back and forth between the two modes. You also need to spend adequate time learning the new material. It's like getting better at lifting weights: you don't just jump in all at once and start with the heaviest weight; you start small and gradually work your way up by doing a little bit every day.

## What is Learning?

A quick download from Dominic: Your brain is made up of neurons. Each neuron can have multiple dendrites, which are like little branches that reach out from the neuron to other neurons. The places where a dendrite connects to another neuron (at the axon) are called synapses. A single dendrite can have multiple synapses.

Contrary to popular belief, your brain is creating new neurons all the time, even after your brain has matured. New neurons are created in your hippocampus - the part of your brain responsible for learning and memory.

Your brain creates and removes connections between neurons every day - that's how you learn new things. When you learn something new and the pinball starts bouncing around, your brain reinforces the synapses on the path that the pinball bounced. As you keep using a concept over time, those synapses get stronger and stronger and the paths between neurons get more established. That makes it easier for you to recall information more quickly.

Connections are stronger when you're in an enriched environment (with stimulation and other people). In the absence of an enriched environment, exercise will also increase the number of new neurons created.

## Procrastination

When you don't want to do something, the pain part of your brain is active. Your brain wants to stop that by switching your attention to something else. But it turns out that you also stop that neural discomfort by just doing the thing you don't want to do.

> 🍅 **The Pomodoro Technique:** Remove yourself from any distractions. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Do the thing you don't want to do. When the timer goes off, reward yourself by doing something else. It's like a mental workout.

## Practice Makes Permanent

The more abstract an idea, the more practice you need to strengthen those neural connections. As you practice, you're strengthening the connections between neurons, and making that pathway more established in your brain. Practice is how you make those neural pathways permanent.

When you're learning something new, spend some time focusing on it, then take a break to let your brain's diffuse mode keep working on it in the background. It's important to take breaks, because that's what's cementing your mental foundation. If you cram, it's like building a wall without giving the cement proper time to dry - it's going to end up looking like a mess.

## Memory

* Long-term memory is where you store information (like a hard drive).
    * Like a storage warehouse. It's big, and there are lots of places to put things.
    * Different kinds of memories are in different parts of your brain.
* Working memory is what you're currently thinking about (like RAM).
    * Based in your prefrontal cortex.
    * Like a bad blackboard. It has limited space, and stuff gets erased quickly.

Your working memory can only hold about four chunks of information at a time. Sometimes you'll have to use repetition to keep reminding yourself of the information so it doesn't get automatically erased by your brain's clean-up processes.

When you first try to put something in long-term memory, you'll have to practice recalling it so that your brain can remember where it put that memory (like trying to find something packed away in your storage unit). This should be done gradually, over the course of many days. This is called **spaced repetition**. Spaced repetition is more effective than cramming the same amount of practice into one day.

## The Importance of Sleep

Being awake creates toxins in your brain. When you sleep, your brain cells shrink, which makes space to let your brain clean out the toxins.

When you sleep, your brain also cleans up and strengthens neural connections. It cleans up less important connections and strengthens the ones for important memories that you want to remember. Your brain also keeps rehearsing the hard things you were working on in focus mode before going to sleep.

For greatest success, work on the thing you're trying to learn right before taking a nap or going to bed. This increases the likelihood that you'll dream about it, which helps your brain organize that information into chunks, which helps you learn it better.

## Chunking

Chunks are groups of related information which your brain can tie together. A chunk is the network of neurons that are connected and help you do a particular thing. Repetition helps build up chunks.

Imagine a puzzle. Each separate piece is like a distinct piece of information. As you put together the puzzle, you build up chunks of connected pieces, which are easier to keep track of and help you get more context on the big picture.

In focus mode, your brain can only hold four different chunks in working memory at once. The size of the chunk doesn't matter. As you practice and get better, your brain starts connecting related chunks into bigger chunks. That means that you can effectively hold more information in your working memory at once!

## Forming a Chunk

When you're first learning, there's a heavy cognitive load. You don't have muscle memory yet, so you might not have the intuition for how it works yet.

That's why it's best to start with a worked-through example. It lets you see the key features and principles behind how to solve the problem.

Make sure to focus on the connections between steps, even if you don't fully understand the individual steps. It's like following a roadmap.

1. Focus your undivided attention on the information you're trying to chunk. Eliminate distractions.
    * Your brain isn't able to make connections as well when you're stressed or angry.
1. Understand the basic idea (the gist).
    * **How do you use this?**
    * This will require you to switch back and forth between focused and diffuse thinking. Focus on the idea in front of you, and then think of ways that it connects to other things you already know.
    * The "a-ha" moment isn't enough to build expertise, but it's the start.
1. Close the book and see if you can actually do it yourself.
    * Doing the thing is how you build the neural pathways to be able to repeat it.
1. Get context.
    * **When do you use this? When do you not use this?**
    * Bottom-up learning means building the chunk before getting context.
    * Top-down learning means getting the big picture of what you're learning. (e.g., looking through a chapter at the pictures before reading it in-depth.)
    * You need both bottom-up and top-down learning to develop mastery.
    
## Illusions of Competence

* Rereading is not as effective as recalling from memory. Close the book and see if you can remember the key ideas without looking.
    * The retrieval process helps strengthen neural connections.
    * Rereading texts only becomes more useful when you let time pass before rereading (spaced repetition).
    * Practice recall in multiple locations, because then those memories won't be tied quite so closely to a specific environment.
* Building concept maps isn't as helpful before you've embedded chunks in the brain, because you don't have a full understanding of the individual concepts yet.
    * It's like trying to learn about chess strategy before you know how the pieces work.
* Glancing at a solution without doing it yourself doesn't mean you've learned it.
* Highlighting and underlining can also trick you into thinking you've learned the material.
    * Try reading the content first before highlighting, to get an idea of the main idea.
    * Annotating notes in the margin is a more effective learning strategy, because you've come up with the notes in your own words.
    
The best way to see if you're truly understanding the material is to **test yourself**. Making mistakes in these self tests is a good thing, because it allows you to correct your understanding before you have to go off and do it on your own.

> How can I build this into my content?
>
> * Use details/summary blocks to review ideas or for exercises, so they can think through it before looking at the answers.
> * Tell/remind readers about the benefits of recall!
> * After explaining a concept, provide examples for users to test themselves on the concepts.

## Motivation

Your emotions affect how well you learn. It's hard to learn something when you're not into it. Chemicals that affect your motivation:

* Acetylcholine
    * Important for focused learning, when you need to pay close attention.
    * Used for creating new long-term memories.
* Dopamine
    * Released when you receive an unexpected reward.
    * Loss of dopamine neurons leads to lack of motivation, Parkinson's.
* Seratonin
    * Affects social life.
    * Influences risk-taking behavior.
    
## Value of Chunking

Building up the number of chunks in your mind allows you to innovate by making connections between concepts.

Imagine a puzzle. Having more chunks of connected pieces allows you to get a more complete idea of the big picture.

If you don't practice to strengthen the chunks, the big picture will remain faint. Practice helps you notice patterns between chunks.

**Transfer:** the ability to relate chunks in one domain to chunks in a seemingly unrelated domain.

If you have a lot to learn, it may feel overwhelming. But persist and take it one chunk at a time, and it will get easier.

## Approaches to Problem Solving

### Method 1: Sequential approach

* Step-by-step solution.
* Involves focused mode of thinking.

### Method 2: Holistic ("global") approach

* a.k.a. intuition. Making connections to find a creative solution.
    * Most difficult problems use this approach, because it requires creative solutions.
* Involves diffuse mode of thinking.
    * Solutions need to be verified with the focused mode, since intuition isn't always correct.

## Overlearning

Continuing to practice after mastering what you can in a single session. Often it can be more effective to take a break and 

* Pros:
    * Can be helpful when you are trying to build up automaticity. (Especially if you get nervous when it's time to actually perform.)
* Cons:
    * Extending a learning session when you've already plateaued isn't as effective as taking a break and then coming back to the material later (spaced repetition).
    * Mastering a single concept can give you the illusion of competence (and make you think you know a wider range of content than you actually do).

A better approach: **deliberate practice** (practice the thing you find difficult).

**Einstellung:** An initial idea you already have can prevent you from finding a better solution. The existing patterns in your brain create a rut that can mislead you.
    
Jumping right into the deep end before studying is a bad idea, because you run the risk of setting up bad connections for incorrect solutions (creating bad intuition).

Best way to learn: **interleaving**. Practice jumping back and forth between problems or situations that need different strategies.

* Mix up your learning. Knowing how to use a concept isn't enough - you also need to know when to use it.
    * Applies to any kind of learning, not just academics. Switching between subjects helps you think more creatively and make connections you wouldn't otherwise make.
* Interleaving may feel more difficult, but it strengthens neural flexibility.
* Interleaving makes it easier to make connections between different fields, and find more creative solutions. Your brain can bring ideas from one field to another.
