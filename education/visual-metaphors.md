# Creating Visual Metaphors

> These notes are from Maggie Appleton's talk, [Drawing the Invisible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQGe9zxlRdk), at the Women of React Conference 2020.

## Process

1. Identify the nouns and verbs.
    * What things and actions do you need to explain?
1. State one main concept in simple, high-level terms.
    * Look for physical properties and categories.
    * e.g., "Components are containers." Everyone in the physical world knows what a container is.
1. Focus on key functions and qualities to highlight.
    * What's important and what's not?
    * Can't explain everything about a topic with a single metaphor. Don't pack too many details into a metaphor.
1. Think laterally to find alternatives.
    * Look at unrelated disciplines.
    * e.g., A React component as a spaceship.
1. Add in specific storytelling elements.
    * Speak human, not computer.
    * "React as a potato plant" is much more memorable than drawing a diagram of a component tree.
    * Humans are storytelling creatures. Hook people with emotion, detail, and originality.
