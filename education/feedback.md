# Feedback

## Giving Constructive Criticism

### ["Wise" Feedback](https://www.interventioncentral.org/student_motivation_wise_feedback)

1. Describe the feedback
    * What is it you want them to improve?
1. Emphasize high standards used to evaluate the work
    * Why is this feedback necessary?
1. Assure student that they have the skills necessary to meet those standards (and use examples of past work/behavior to reinforce)
    * How can you help them believe in themselves?

### "Plan B" (from [Lost at School](https://sites.google.com/site/melynnsportfolio/standard-eight/lost-at-school-a-reflection))

1. Empathy
    * Give the student a chance to explain themselves before you jump to conclusions.
    * "I've noticed that [describe the behavior in an unbiased way]. What's up?"
1. Define
    * Confirm that you understand their perspective.
    * Voice your concerns with the way things are currently being handled.
1. Invitation
    * Ask the student what they thing an appropriate solution would be.
        * By having the student propose the solution, they'll hopefully have more buy in.
    * If the solution doesn't work for you, let them know that and continue discussing until they find a mutually satisfactory solution.

Note:

* Avoid "Plan A" (i.e., enforcing your will as the adult, "pulling rank")
* Avoid "Plan C" (i.e., lowering expectations)
