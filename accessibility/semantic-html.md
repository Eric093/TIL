# Semantic HTML

By using semantic HTML, you can take advantage of accessibility features that are already built into browsers. Just because you can make a `div` be a `button` doesn't mean you should.

## Choosing the right element

* Button vs. checkbox toggle?
    * Use a checkbox when the user needs to take another action to submit the result (i.e. in a form).
    * Use a button when clicking the element immediately triggers the action.

* Details / summary vs. custom accordion?
    * Details / summary doesn't work well with all browsers, so a custom accordion might be better.
