# Parallax Animation

Inspiration: The hero image for [Eve Porcello's GraphQL Workshop site](https://www.graphqlworkshop.com/)

* The different layers of the image move at different rates when you scroll, so it looks like the camera position is moving.
* The campfire animation is a separate SVG that is positioned on top of the ground layer. (I don't really know how it works.) The flying birds animations are also a separate SVG.
