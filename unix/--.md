# Using `--` as a Command Line Argument

When you use `--` as a command line argument, it specifies that all the following arguments should get passed to whatever's running.

In other words, when the shell sees `--`, it knows that everything that comes after should be treated as an argument for the command, not an option.

This is notable because, usually, anything in the command that starts with a `-` gets treated as an option. But if you use `--`, you can pass in arguments even if they start with `-`.
## Example
I have my Node project set up to run my linter when I use the command:

`$ npm run lint`

If I want to run my linter with the `--fix` argument, then I could pass this argument to my Node command using the same script with the `--` argument:

`$ npm run lint -- --fix`

This will pass `--fix` as an additional argument to the same script that normally runs my linter!
